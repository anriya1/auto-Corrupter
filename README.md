# 🌀 Wrong Correct - The Auto Corrupter

> A web app that *fixes* your text... into total nonsense.

**Wrong Correct** is an intentionally chaotic auto-correction tool. You paste or type in normal text, and it first "auto-corrects" it — then "auto-corrupter" kicks in and messes everything up. Misspellings, grammatical errors, gibberish... total meaning loss guaranteed. Why? Because language is overrated.
