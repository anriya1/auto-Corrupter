# 🤖 WrongCorrect™ – The Auto Corrupter

> **"Correctly incorrect your perfectly correct text."**

WrongCorrect™ is a web-based tool that takes user input (typed or pasted text), pretends to auto-correct it, but instead applies advanced AI-inspired algorithms to introduce realistic, chaotic, and often hilarious spelling mistakes.

It’s built for fun, chaos, and creative misuse. Think of it as the anti-grammar tool.
